# Dana's Work:
My works for tasks in path1, about mechanical designing and 3D printing, can be found here. 
For organization purpose, folders were created to represent the disgn of different patrs.


In General, various factors such as weight, cost, and so on were kept in mind while redesigning the arm and elbow parts. The design was built from scratch without relaying on the open source files by using bool and bend tools. It was made with consideration of the right and left sides.

* With the purpose of reducing the weight, the used objects were emptied from inside.
* For safety and organization purposes, specific parts were designed for each motor.
* The motors' wires can be organized from inside to give the robot better look. 
* Names in Arabia and English were used to design each part to give them a special look. 
* My name in Arabic can be found in front which used as a signiture of my work. 
* The robot name (Poppy) was shortaged to PoB and was printed on the side to avoid problems. 

** One important thing to note: The designs were done without paying attention to the right dimenssions for now and this is because the purpose of this task was taken as a learning tool and to familarize myself to the program. Short explanation can be found under each uploaded part. 
* More information about the motors and joints can be found in their specific folders.
